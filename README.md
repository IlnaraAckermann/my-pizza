# My Pizza Project

This project is part of the [Complete Intro to React, v9](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v9) course on Frontend Masters. The course covers a wide range of topics to help you become proficient in React and its ecosystem.

## Course Overview

### Development Setup

In this section, we set up the development environment, including installing and configuring essential tools like npm for package management, Prettier for code formatting, ESLint for linting, and Git for version control.

### React Basics

We start with the basics of React, understanding how to use React without any build tools. We learn how to run React applications without a build step and create and use React components effectively.

### Core React Concepts

This section dives into the core concepts of React, including writing JSX syntax, using React hooks for state and lifecycle management, managing side effects with useEffect, handling user inputs and forms, and using React Context for state management.

### Advanced React

We explore advanced topics in React, such as creating custom hooks, using React Portals for rendering outside the main DOM hierarchy, handling errors with Error Boundaries, and working with uncontrolled forms.

### React Ecosystem

We explore the React ecosystem, using Vite as a build tool and tools like TanStack Router for routing and TanStack Query for managing server state.

### Testing

This section covers writing tests for React applications using Vitest. We learn how to test user interactions and custom hooks, use snapshot testing, and run browser tests with Playwright.

### Future Topics

We look into future topics, including exploring new features in React 19, using `use` and `Suspense` for data fetching, understanding the React compiler, and deploying the React application.
